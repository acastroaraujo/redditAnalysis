This is a rework of the original Reddit app.

Proof of concept will be on https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/

Some keyword buckets

- Responsibility

- Trust

- Workforce

- AI

- Equality

****

The idea is providing an analysis on entire subreddits, but allowing the user to pinpoint at specific threads.

It should have the following tabs.

1. Thread explorer.

    i. Keyword search. 
    
    ii. TF

2. Comparison between threads.

    i. TF-IDF
    
    ii. Topic Modeling.
    
    iii. Bipartite graph analysis of users and threads

3. Overall analysis, word2vec, and stuff.  

    i. What are they talking about?
    
    ii. Who are these people (maybe check user linkdage between subthreads).
    
    iii. Drivers of positive or negative brand engagement.
    
    iv. w2v cosine similarities.
    
4. Methodology

Other things.

1. Detect relevance of specific users

2. Competitors?

3. Detect threads that answer relevant questions? 

4. Detect current, lapsed, or prospect customers.

5. Fill in the "I think...", "In my experience...", etc.
